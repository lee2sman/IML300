# Branching Narrative or Internet Yama-Ichi

Due: 10/23

# Branching Narrative

Hypertext and hyperlinking are a fundamental feature of the modern web. We take for granted that using the net means surfing from webpage to webpage. Early web-based artists and creative practitioners experimented with this new medium, creating hyperlink media (hypermedia) and new forms of narrative storytelling. 

For this project you will create a hyperlinked narrative project with HTML, CSS and Javascript. We will have a warm-up and several stages leading up to the completion of the project.

### Grading will be based on

* demonstrated understanding of the material
* conceptually creativity
* aesthetic quality
* technical skill

### Steps


1. Warm-up: Read [Power To The People: The Text Adventures of Twine](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/power-to-the-people-the-text-adventures-of-twine/1100-6402665/) or [Twine: The Videogame Technology For all](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/magazine/twine-the-video-game-technology-for-all.html). Play a Twine game or view an online branching narrative that we did not cover in class. Make a page linked off your class website. Include the title and creator. Describe the work. Include images if helpful. Write a short description of the work and then describe what you find compelling about the work (or what you think didn't work well).

2. Develop a concept that will guide the creation of your project. Are you telling a story? Is is straightforward, disjointed or abstract? How will you explain the concept and how will users know how to navigate?

3. Plan out the project with a sitemap and wireframing. What are the technical parts underlying your site? What styling will you use? What scripting will you need to include?

4. Build a draft version of your site. Make sure to do iterative testing as you build it to ensure its functionality. Do user testing and get feedback and make refinements.

### Optional

* Alternatively, you may create a web-based project inspired by the [Internet Yama-ichi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjWJsE7B1cs). Select something not presently online (an object, a concept, a place, etc) and presenting it online on its own website. You should follow the same steps as above but rather than develop a narrative you will create a site dedicated to this particular work or concept. Like the narrative project outlined above this project should be compelling, innovative and well-executed.
