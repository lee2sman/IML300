## Building Structure

### Div and Span
* used to apply targeted styles to a contained set of content.
* <div> is a block-level element that is commonly used to identify large groupings of content, and which helps to build a web pageâ€™s layout and design.
* <span> is an inline-level element commonly used to identify smaller groupings of text within a block-level element.
* both are commonly used with class or id attributes for styling purposes


#### Block-level elements
* Begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width. 
* May be nested inside one another and may wrap inline-level elements. 
* Most commonly used for larger pieces of content, such as paragraphs.

#### Inline-level elements
* Do not begin on a new line
* They fall into the normal flow of a document, lining up one after the other, and only maintain the width of their content.
* may be nested inside one another; however, they cannot wrap block-level elements.
* used with smaller pieces of content, such as a few words.


## Homework

1. Read:
	* [Getting To Know CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/)
	* [Opening The Box Model](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/opening-the-box-model/)
	* [Positioning Content](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/)
2. Create:
	* Create a basic HTML index page to hold links to all your work this semester, and post online on your Storm space. We will build this site iteratively, so consider this just the first version of your site. Somewhere on this page create a link to a second page.
	*  On this second page, you will post hyperlinks to five websites you are interested in this week. Find 5 links of sites this week that you like or dislike and write a few lines about what you find (or do not find) interesting. If you want, you can replace 2 of the links with images of designs or interations as long as you explain what the images are. Your links can be chosen based on design, interaction, content, etc. But they should be something that you think is interesting enough to share with others.
3. Email tusman at usc with a link to your webspace
