# Net Neutrality

### What is it?
* Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers must treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication.
* a belief that governments should regulate broadband Internet services as a public utility, similar to the way electricity, gas, and the water supply are regulated

### Why is this in the news?
* In February 2015 the FCC reclassified broadband internet as a telecommunications service and published follow-up rules for net neutrality
* On November 21 new FCC Chairman (appointed by the president) Ajit Pai unveiled plans to rollback net neutrality rules and opened to public comment

### Arguments for net neutrality
* Net neutrality keeps the internet fair
* it keeps companies from speeding up, slowing down or blocking any content, applications or websites you want to use
* Numerous examples of this:  In 2007 the FCC sued Comcast for interfering with traffic from BitTorrent, the file transfer service. The commission lost, owing to a lack of legal basis for the complaintâ€”basis it later achieved with the 2015 reclassification.
* FCC Chairman Pai was a former Verizon lawyer

# Arguments against
* Government shouldn't regulate internet like a utility
