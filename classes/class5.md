# Homework
* Check out 3 web artworks from Rhizome's [Artbase](http://rhizome.org/art/artbase). Make a new page off your class assignment site. Write about each of these 3 web-based artworks. Who created it? What's the concept? What do you find compelling about the work?
* Create a plan for your project. What is your concept? What will things look like? What's the story/plan? Sketch out 10 - 15 pages. There should be at least 3 different 'endings.' You can sketch in your notebook or in photoshop/illustrator/etc but if you draw on paper please scan in or photograph your sketches. If you are stuck on how to begin, look back on your previous assignments to describe 5 links and your reviews/summaries of a Twine game and 3 sites above. What are you interested in? Follow your interests and passion.
