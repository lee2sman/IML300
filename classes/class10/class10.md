## Assignment

* Working in groups of two, create a design proposal describing the structure and functionality for the website of an art or design related organization, institution or company of your choosing (museum, art school, gallery, collection, archive, design shop, font foundry, community center, fab lab, etc.). If the chosen organization has an existing site, you may use it as a starting point, but your design ideas should not be limited by how the site currently looks, works, or even the information it contains. Develop concepts for a core structure that suites the different needs of the organization, and find ways to visually implement this structure, helping the organization represent itself appropriately online. You are allowed to cut, move, add, or combine any of the existing information found on the current site.

Your proposal must include:

A written text (~ 250 words) in which you:

Analyze the main audience / target group, and their potential expectations as they visit the site.
Describe the core needs of the organization in their communication through a web-site (e.g. a time / calendar based view of their events, an archive of past exhibitions / projects, educational section, visits & directions, etc.).
Identify the key elements and concepts of your design proposal. Think of how the potential of the web can be taken advantage of for this particular case. Try to come up with new, refreshing design patterns where you see fit, or creative uses of existing ones.
Two short user stories (~ 125 word each) that give concrete examples of how people from your target groups will use the site, giving a clear idea for how each type of user is served by your proposed structure.

Visual materials supporting the proposal, consisting of:

A sitemap of your proposed structure for the site.
At least two wireframes, one of the home page, and at least one of other pages you deem to be the most important to the conception of your site. The more wireframes you develop, the clearer the structural requirements of the website will become.
As you compile the proposal, ask yourself these questions:

How does your design make the site exciting to use?
How does it help the organization to represent itself and put emphasis on what it really is about?
How does it distinguish the site from other similar sites?
Your document should be put together as a single PDF file.
